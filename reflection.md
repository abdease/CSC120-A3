Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
    Maura Putzer

- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
    Was not able to attend.

- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
    After working in Java some, I have found that it reminds me of a combination of Python and SQL. I do find SQL to be a little more intuitive than Python, so in that sense, Java is like writing in SQL with Python-like syntax. 

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
    The functionality of the languages is very similiar in terms of ability to loop and work with ranges and storing variables. Otherwise, I do feel like they are pretty different because Java forces you to repeatedly call things and does not provide as much leeway.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    I would definitely recommend using the resources available to you in TA/office hours. I was unable to attend this week but it likely would have helped a lot. It is a lot of trial and error and attemping to apply any transferrable Python knowledge to Java. I definitely got stuck on making and printing out a transcript of the full conversation at the end.
